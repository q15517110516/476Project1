# Project 1: Markovian Tweets
The task is to take in sample text and generate a tweet (280 characters) in the style of that text using Markov Chains. For super-extra credit consume a user name from Twitter and grab some tweets by the person as your source material. Further awesomeness if you build a tweet-bot.

## Project 1 Milestones
This task is designed to push you a bit. You'll have to figure out many moving parts to make it a success. Here are some mastery tasks you can measure yourself by and talk to me if you get stuck.

Ingest Data. You'll need to be able to parse data I provide at submission time so think about formats and storage. For the inspired folk this will require an additional step of requesting and parsing data from Twitter's API.
Study Algorithms. Markov Chains for generating sentences isn't a hard task of the course, it is an example of my faith in you as internet-age bright capable people. So the real goal is that you can look for a few different approaches and decide which one would be most feasible to implement.
Computation in C/C++. Because you're going to need to get some sort of probabilistic next phrase you'll have to play with distributions and data structures. Depending on your algorithmic choice this might go down the route of matrices or graphs but you'll need to deploy some math for sure.
